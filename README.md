# Cricket-Predictions
This repository contains an AI-based cricket analytics application developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence coursework. The project applies supervised machine learning techniques to historical cricket data in order to predict match outcomes and classify player performance.

📌 Project Overview

The application focuses on two key problem domains:

1️⃣ Cricket Match Outcome Prediction

Predicts whether a team will Win or Lose a match

Treated as a binary classification problem

2️⃣ Player Performance Classification

Classifies player performance into High, Medium, or Low categories

Treated as a multi-class classification problem

Both tasks are implemented using a structured machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Match Outcome Prediction

Logistic Regression – primary baseline model

Decision Tree Classifier

k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)

Player Performance Classification

Random Forest Classifier

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical computation

Scikit-learn – machine learning models and evaluation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

🔄 Development Workflow

Load and explore the cricket dataset

Clean and preprocess data

Encode categorical features and scale numerical values

Split data into training and testing sets

Train supervised learning models

Evaluate models using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

Compare model performance and analyze results

📊 Results Summary

Logistic Regression demonstrated stable and interpretable performance for match outcome prediction

Decision Tree and k-NN provided effective comparative results

Random Forest achieved strong performance for multi-class player performance classification

Detailed results, evaluation metrics, and confusion matrices are available in the Jupyter Notebook.

🚀 Future Improvements
